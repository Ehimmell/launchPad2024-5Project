Review
Favorite teacher ever. Did a great job answering questions. His study guides and review sessions were super helpful
"Be prepared to be frightened during the first few lectures, and please do not ask a question if you have any kind of social anxiety. He will remember you and ask you questions in the following lectures. He kept lectures light with memes and jokes. Actually makes you understand what's going on. Best calc teacher I've had by far."
If you have him be ready for a great semester
Very good teacher. Entertaining classes!
"Professor Matsuki has a genuine passion for teaching and really cares about his students learning the material and understanding why, which is extremely helpful in an abstract course. His lectures are actually interesting and he consistently makes jokes and becomes friendly with the students. Amazing professor and teacher."
"Simply put, there's a reason this dude's a legend. Very engaging lectures that actually make sense. He is also by a vast margin the best course coordinator at Purdue. I'm shocked Kenji's back hasn't broken yet from carrying Purdue's math dept. His office hours are also god tier. 100/10"
"Love this guy. He explains topics well and will actually reword things if asked questions instead of just repeating it. I've heard great things about his office hours. Go to lectures before exams because he will give you hints about what is on them! Not a tech savvy guy. He is very sassy, so don't take anything personally. Truly a softie at heart."
"Professor Matsuki is one of the best math professors in Purdue. His lectures are always funny and useful. If you miss lectures, he summarizes the topics in 3-4 10 minute videos that go over each main topic in the lecture. He holds office hours regularly and provides study guides pretty much have the exam questions on them."
"It was amazing that he posted study guides so that we could study for exams. However, he always picked the hardest questions out of there so you pretty much have to memorize the whole study guide. He is not the best lecturer, instead of lecturing material, he goes over homework during class and posts the actual course material later as videos."
"10/10 prof. Kenji brings so much joy and life to his lectures, they aren't boring in the slightest. There's some homework in the class but it's not bad. The midterms and final all have study guides, so as long as you master those you should be pulling anywhere from a low B to a high A on every exam. Not too hard of a class, really fun"
"He is a super funny professor, and his lectures are very engaging. Come to his lectures even if you are not lucky enough to have him as a professor. He reads the room very well and can tell when people don't understand something by how they react to what he is saying. Use the study guide that he makes, and you will be okay."
"Kenji was a great professor and I wish he was my professor next semester. His lectures were fun and he always managed to make me laugh. Definitely take him. Just don't be on your phone. He will make fun of you for sure but by the end of the year he asks you questions. This is what I observed at least. Basically, just take his classes."
"Fantastic professor with a great sense of humor. His lectures were fantastic but he is very strict about his no phone/laptop policy and will call you out for not paying attention. Definitely do the study guides for exams, you're guaranteed to pass if you do them since most questions will appear on the exam."
"Kenji might possibly be the best math teacher I have ever had in my life. He is really funny and makes lectures so fun. He also teaches the material well and gives study guides that mirror the test decently well. If you study decently hard, you will do amazing!"
"Kenji is quite literally the GOAT. Funniest professor I've ever had, no doubt about it. He keeps everyone engaged, frequently reads the room to gauge our level of comprehension, and genuinely cares about his students. He also gives away exactly what types of questions will be on exams. I have never admired a professor as much as I do Kenji."
"Kenji Matsuki is a great teacher and lecturer. You will always be engaged. When it comes to learning, he will post all of his lectures online, however, it is highly recommended that you go to the actual lectures as he will give answers to study guides for the tests. Most exams are questions pulled from the study guide so learn it by heart."
"Kenji is great. Best personality out of all my professors, and somehow makes lectures fun. Study exam study guides inside and out, as he pulls most questions directly from them--but don't memorize, learn from it too. If you keep up on the quizzes and twice-a-week homework, you'll be fine. Exams are large portion of grade, so prepare soon."
He teaches well but my experience reaching him outside of class is awful. He is energetic and emotional sometimes.
"Prof. Matsuki always does his best to make sure lectures are entertaining. If you don't have him, go to his lectures anyway. This has been said a lot, but the study guides he provides are almost identical to the exam. He wants everyone to pass. That being said, this is still a college calculus course so it will be difficult."
I had Professor Matsuki for both MA162 and MA 166. He loves to joke with his students and does a great job of making lectures entertaining and fun. The biggest takeaway from both classes: DO THE STUDY GUIDES!!!
"This guy is the GOAT of Purdue math. If you don't have him, go to his lectures anyway because a lot of exam material will be covered in class. Great lectures too."
"For calc I and II, his study guides were amazing since the exams contained questions from them. However, this encouraged a memorization-heavy approach to calc which might not be good for actually learning it. Additionally, Kenji sometimes runs out of time meaning he won't teach the hw material until the day it's due."
"This guy is an absolute legend. Writes the exams and walks through problems that will be on the exam. If you don't have him, go to his lectures anyway. Study the study guide, because the problems on there will be almost identical to the exam questions."
"I thought he was so funny and many other people thought that too. He will basically tell you what questions will be on the exam and how to do them, which helped me get a good grade in the class. You can tell he was a good teacher because, after the last lecture, all the students gave him a round of applause."
"I can't recommend Matsuki enough! I was lucky to have him when he was making exams, & he often will hint very obviously at question types that will show up on the test to help students. If you aren't in his class go to his as he makes his interesting. For exams just do his study guides early & often, those are all the questions you'll be tested on!"
"Prof. Matsuki is the goat. I cannot stress enough how great he is. His lectures are hilarious and easy to follow most of the time. It's evident he cares about his students and their learning. He will randomly show memes or make funny comments. Making Purdue Math bearable, much less likable, is a tough job but he gets it done."
Matsuki Is an amazing professor. He is a great teacher and absolutely hilarious. I wish he could be my math professor every semester. Follow his study guides very closely!
Professor Matuski is a great lecturer and keeps class pretty interesting. He explains lots of proofs before how to do specific problems which can help but are also quite confusing but as long as you understand how to do the work you will be fine.
"One of the best math professors I've had is funny and engaging in lectures, does a good job of making material understand, in is fair in his exams and grading. He can get behind on his lectures, and you'll likely have to watch some of his supplemental videos to stay up to date, but he's an all-around great choice."
His lectures are good but he sometimes overexplains concepts that arent exactly necessary and he can be very patronizing. The reason i give him a good rating is because he still does a decent job and he gives a study guide for the test that got me A's on every exam.
Professor Matuski is a great lecturer and keeps class. pretty interesting. He explains lots of proofs before how to do specific problems which can help but are also quite confusing but as long as you understand how to do the work you will be fine.
He writes the exams and the study guide. If you have him you basically have all the exam answers ahead of time.
"Kenji is the GOAT at Purdue, and that's 100% true. Supper funny and exciting lectures. The problem is broken down into step-by-step instruction and is very easy to understand. He's also really sweet during office hours too. I would definitely choose his classes again!"
"Solid professor, although he tends to move a little slowly, meaning that all the material in a lecture might not be covered in full. He's very funny and is a good option for taking calc, especially when the other options are below 2/5."
"His lectures were amazing and taught very well. He makes study guides and hand written answer keys for the exams which help tremendously. If you miss his lecture, his whole lecture can be found on brightspace after the lecture has ended. Only thing to beware is that he uses brightspace like it is a blog, but it is very easy to get used to."
Kenji is an amazing professor. He provides very clear examples that are easy to follow and make concepts much easier to grasp. He also makes jokes and tells funny stories to help keep the class engaged. He writes very hard exams but gives out a comprehensive study guide that makes it easy to succeed on exams if you work hard.
"Best Professor I have ever had by far, If you have to opportunity to take his class, 100% take it. I have always been good at math, however, I have never had a better understanding of math until now. Exams are difficult, but it is very easy to study for them, he provides a study guide and an answer key showing you how to do each problem."
Wasn't even assigned and pulled up and all I gotta say is homie is the GOAT. Best lecturer you'll ever have.
Very good lecturer. If you cannot get him as your lecturer then go to his lectures anyway. It's worth it.
"Best professor at Purdue. If you get him, you're gonna love your life. Explains everything very well. He is hilarious and overall just a precious man you'll find yourself getting attached to."
"Every single student at purdue knows that kenji is the best lecturer. He does his best to engage students during lectures and wants everyone to succeed. My favorite thing about him is that he posts videos for every lecture, so the content is easy to follow if you don't go to lectures"
lectures are all online so no need to go but make sure you take the notes!
Great teacher was honestly once of the easiest math classes to follow!
"Professor Matsuki is one of my favorite professors I have had at Purdue. The class is definitely challenging but he makes lectures as fun as he can and is so funny. Attendance is not mandatory, but I recommend you go. Test are hard at times but doable. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS IF YOU NEED HELP!!!"
Literally the GOAT
Amazing professor i am in love with Matsuki
"Matsuki was by far the best math professor I've had. Trust me, I'm a senior."
great math professor
"Professor Matsuki is an amazing lecturer. He made sure to gauge the class constantly to make sure we all understood him and would very frequently give help on tough homework problems during class. He had a great sense of humor as well; no lecture was boring. If you can get him for Calc 1, you definitely should."
"He has a study guide with actual questions to practice on, while my 166 prof only have a outlined study guide with nothing on it, so i decided to come back and give him a 5 star"
"Prof. Matsuki was one of the best professors that I had. He made Calculus 1 very easy to understand and all of the exams were quite passable, as he made the study guide and only used questions from the study guide. He was a great lecturer and would take his class again."
"Professor Matsuki was the best professor for Calculus 1. He made the lectures very entertaining and they helped very much in preparation for the exams. Also, he uploads study guides with similar questions to the exams so you can excel on them if you do the study guides."
"Kenji is awesome, writes his own reviews."
"Kenji is the goat, hes an absolute legend. The study guide and video lectures are all you need to pass."
"Kenji is my favorite professor at Purdue. It seems as if he genuinely cares, and he puts forward the education of the student first. His lectures are very relaxed, and he does his best to help out whenever he can. In return for this, though, the content can be a little harder so be willing to put in the effort."
Make sure you go over the study guide and try doing it on your own instead of just looking at the answers because he gonna take questions from the study guide with wordings/numbers changed. I was in hybrid section so I didnt go to his lectures but he posted lectures on Brightspace and they were really straightforward! I also like his sense of humor
"He effectively kept me engaged while going over the material. He constantly goes back and asks if everyone is ok and if they understand, and if anyone so much as looks confused, he will attempt to explain in more depth. He also just gave us the questions for the first exam, so that was nice. He stopped doing that for the second/third though."
"Pros: He teaches by working through the problems with the class, posts videos for most lessons in case you miss class, and provides study guides with keys for every exam. Cons: The workload is a lot. 2-3 hw and 1 quiz a week. 3 Midterms are 1 hr for 12-14 questions. Final is 25 questions for 2 hours. Can be a bit short-tempered at times."
"Kenji's lectures are great and he explains things very well. However, the material that is on the homework and tests is very different and much harder than the stuff covered in lectures. Goes over basics very well, struggles to get into the details. Very good study guides."
Kenji is my dawg
"Kenji keeps lectures relaxed, cares that his students understand the material during lecture, and literally gives the study guide for the test questions. Not much more could be asked of a professor in my opinion."
a straight g. favorite professor
"Matsuki is a great professor, I had him for MA 165 as well. He is engaging with the class and good at explaining the material. However, since I took this during COVID times, my exams were all online, which made testing much easier."
Kenji Matsuki is my favorite professor here at Purdue. His lectures are fantastic. He always is energetic and happy and hes great at explaining the material in a way that is palatable yet concise. I highly recommend having his as a professor.
Great Prof. Helped me get through calculus all over again with a new perspective.
Professor Matsuki is an amazing professor. He was funny in class and made complex calculus concepts easy to digest. He recorded his lectures so we could view them even if we skipped class. He wrote the exams and he would make a great study guide. Watch his exam reviews and do the study guide to do well on the exams!
Very entertaining but also teaches very well
"Kenji was a god send during my otherwise horrible classes in the pandemic. His videos explaining each topic are full of helpful information. The class grades consist of HW, weekly quizzes, and Exams. The quizzes allow infinite attempts and the exam study guide is what will be on the exam (different numbers ofc). Quirky, intelligent, and kind man!"
Kenji makes even the most difficult content enjoyable to learn and entertains you while teaching it
"Professor Matsuki is by far one of the best professors at Purdue, especially in the math department. He made calc 1 much more bearable and even enjoyable at times. He is thorough in his lectures and is always willing to help students. He always asks ""are you okay?"" and will re-explain material when he can tell the class is stuck. Amazing professor."
Professor Matsuki was very entertaining in lectures and was a great teacher. He gave plenty of information about the tests. If you put the work in you will get a good grade. I would highly likely recommend this professor.
"Professor Matsuki is by far my favorite lecturer so far. He does not rush through material, and cracks jokes throughout so it is engaging. Try to get him as your professor for the review sessions before the exams alone-- they are very helpful."
"Kenji is great. Definitely do the study guides that he gives you for the exams, though."
"Prof. Matsuki is one of the most hilarious profs at Purdue. If you've never taken calc before, his lengthy explanations will be helpful to you. If you HAVE taken calc before, you probably don't need to watch/go to all of the lectures. He also provides lots of practice problems for exams which are EXTREMELY helpful. Overall, a good professor."
"Kenji is one of the best math professors at Purdue. He genuinely cares about his students and their success and has entertaining lectures. He gives (lengthy) study guides for the tests that have all of the test problems in them, you just don't know which problems they are. He's very helpful at office hours and will answer any question you have"
"I've written a review before, however, I CANNOT advocate for Prof Matsuki enough. I cannot stress how much he cares for his students' understanding of the topics he covers. He reacted to the transfer to remote learning incredibly. If you have the chance to take his class, take it. Point blank, he is the best mathematics teacher I've ever had. Ever."
"This was my second time taking the class, and Kenji was the best! He provides a study guide with similar problems to the exams beforehand, and he always made an answer sheet as well. His lectures are not technically mandatory, but he does make learning the content as enjoyable as possible so I wouldn't skip them."
"Kenji Matsuki is the dream professor. He makes sure students understand what is going on in lecture, and he makes detailed study guides that reflect the exams well. To pass the class, go to lecture, do the study guides, and you're good to go. Wonderful guy, made learning tough concepts much better."
This guy is great. 10/10
"Kenji over explains most concepts and introduces background and origins of most, if not all concepts, which is great for getting an understanding, but typically causes students to jump through tedious hoops to get out their final answer. Id recommend taking 162 with chen if possible, as I've heard much better things from my peers in that class"
"Go to lectures. He knows what he is talking about, and is able to read the room very well. If students struggled on a certain question on an exam, then he will go over it in detail in the next lecture. Many practice problems to apply concepts and tricks. For the love of god, pray you get Kenji and do the study guide."
"I was originally in the other lecturer for my Calc class, and failed the first exam. Matsuki deeply cares that his students do well and is OVERALL AMAZING. 100% great professor"
"Words cannot even begin to describe how forever grateful I am for this man- actually, this God. He is waaayyyy too good. TOO GOOD! To the point of worship. To the point where his difficult exams is 100% justifiable. His lectures are also very hilarious. I'm in the hybrid section but he is so good I walk across campus just for him. A godsend."
This guy is an absolute god. Please teach all of my classes.
Absolute. Legend.
"Wonderful man, wonderful professor."
"Interesting guy and a solid lecturer, but tough exams where the average can be at time as low as 50%. Unfortunately, math is still almost as equally irritating for me under Matsuki."
good professors!
"Just a great math professor! He adds humor to the class, teaches as a fairly slow pace, responds to the reaction of the lecture hall (if you don't understand something he can tell and will go over the material again in detail)"
"What cant be said about Kenji that already hasnt if your taking calc 1 and 2 at Purdue pray you get kenji. What an amazing focused funny and engaging teacher i couldnt praise him more, his slight Japanese accent is easily understandable and his lectures are not mandatory but extremely helpful i went to everyone and was always glad i did"
He gave us hints as to which questions would be on the exams. Pay attention to his study guides- the exam questions are basically verbatim for the study guide questions.
"Go to his lectures. He's so funny! And while being funny he still explains concepts very well, and he never made me regret a single lecture I went to. NEVER."
"He is amazing, prepares everyone for tests well and makes you want to show up for class. Best professor I've ever had hands down."
Kenji makes lectures very interesting. He is very caring and wants his students to do well. If you do the study guide before each exam you should easily get an A. He goes over what is important for the exam. He is also a very funny guy.
"He is very thorough in his lectures. He goes over sample problems for the homework every class and gives worked-out solutions to the study guide. As long as you go over the study guide you should get a C in the class. Kenji constantly goes, ""Are you okay?"" or when the class is confused he says, ""Oh no, I am failing"" and explains the concept again."
"Remember, when the graph of ln(x) approaches zero, in goes D E E P D O W N."
"Fantastic professor who is easy to understand, and keeps math lectures interesting enough to pay attention. Even in a huge lecture hall he is willing to take questions. He never fails to make the class laugh multiple times a lecture."
Kenji is absolutely hilarious & truly explains content well. Take him if you get the chance.
"Amazing teacher, nobody explains the concepts like him and his sense of humour is unmatched by all other Purdue professors."
Tough class but great and hilarious professor. Attendance isn't required but 10/10 recommend because he explains hard homework and problems that will be on the exam. Great study guides and usually good curves.
"Kenji is a good professor, i am just a bad student."
"The best math professor at Purdue without a doubt. I enjoyed going to lecture. He is so funny and teaches calculus so that everyone understands. He would often pause and ask if everyone understood. If someone did not, he would go back and explain. Get Kenji if you can!!"
Kenji is the only way to get through purdue engineering calc classes.
"Kenji made class entertaining, as well as doing a great job of teaching the material."
He is just wonderful.
"I took Calc I in high school and definitely did not need to go to the lectures, but I went to every single one just because he was so funny."
"Best Professor! He is really funny, and knows how to connect well with students. His study guides really helped to prepare you for the tests and exams. 100% would recommend him."
"Kenji was phenomenal, made calculus 165 a blast. Definitely seek his office hours for help, he will gladly learn your name and where you struggle in math and help you change your perspective on many mathematical problems. He's a blast to have and we even organized events around his birthday, everyone in his class loved him as a professor"
"Kenji is an amazing professor! He really cares that everyone understands what is going on. He makes study guides for the exams, and they are VERY similar to the test! He is also super funny!"
"Fantastic professor. Gives clear explanations for problems, keeps students engaged by being hilarious, generally seems to really want his students to succeed. Will push you to perform your best."
"Kenji was great. His lectures were fun and he made all of his students laugh. The tests were hard, but there was still a fair curve and considering how low we scored on Exam 2, he made Exam 3 really easy to bring our grades up. He is a great teacher and really cares that you understand the material."
"Look, look, look! He is a great professor who has engaging lectures that cover all of the material presented on tests. If you attend lecture and recitation and work the study guides, you will be able to do well in the course. He is also very open to students attending his office hours and will help every student who asks for the help."
Despite some saying he looks like Jackie Chan! No!! He really doesn't regardless he is probably one of the best professors.
Hes awesome
"Kenji Matsuki is the greatest math lecturer I've ever had. He is a funny guy and really tries to make his lectures interesting so that students don't get distracted. It's easy to see that he really does care about his students. I'm not a math major, but I wish I could take a math class with Kenji every semester."
"He was an amazing professor! He really helped giving hints on what was to come on the exam and how to explain concepts. He also knew how to get along with the students, as well as, make you WANT to come to class. There were even students from other sections in his class keeping them always full."
"Great Professor, he makes the lecture enjoyable with his humor and good teaching skills. Will always take him if can.."
Kenji is the funniest and makes really good lectures. Understands and relates to students very well and tries not to fail his students. Highly recommend to take his class because he is serious and knowledgeable but also funny.
"Kenji is easily one of the greatest teachers I have had at Purdue. His lectures are very insightful and full of valuable information. Although I have enjoyed math since middle school, I can say with confidence that while his exams are tough, Professor Matsuki made me want to learn math more than any other teacher."
"Amazing Calc professor, his lectures are super clear. 100% would recommend taking his class. The exams are hard but his review sessions are very helpful."
Solid lectures where he usual gives away harder exam questions ;)
BEST PROFESSOR AT PURDUE! HE IS AMAZAING!
"Had him for calc 1/2 and he is honestly the best professor I've had so far at Purdue. I did not take AP calc in high school so I was pretty worried that I wouldn't do well in college; However, Kenji does an amazing job at simplifying complex concepts and giving us good examples in class so you can complete the homeworks and exams successfully."
His lectures are dope.
"Self-intro first: freshman, international student from China. Pro: + patient, cute and humorous + no heavy accent + hold lecture with clear logic + no need for reading textbook Fair: take note by hands no laptop allowed Con: - have OCD, lol - difficult exam - lots of homework Keep calm and choose Kenji. I bet you will learn a lots!"
"Kenji is one of the best math professors I have ever had. He explains everything clearly and in multiple ways, and has a knack for knowing when he needs to slow down because you do not understand. In addition, he goes over practice problems that are helpful for when you take the exam. MA 165 is very difficult, but Kenji makes it easier."
Matsuki is an amazing lecturer and makes sure to point out the types of questions that will be on the exams. I look forward to taking MA 166 from him.
Makes lecture entertaining while also explaining topics clearly
"Amazing professor, and amazing man. Extremely engaging during lectures. Has a bit of an accent, but still easy to understand. His tests are usually pretty difficult, but he does help prepare you by reviewing for them and hinting at what types of questions to expect."
"Kenji cares about the students' success and really wants everyone to do well. He relies heavily on visual examples, so if you're a visual learner, he would be a great professor for you."
Engaging and makes sure the students know the information.
Great teacher couldn't ask for more
"Kenji is a very funny teacher and I loved going to his lectures. I had previous experience with the material, so lectures weren't always useful to me, but I think he generally did a good job teaching the material. If he realizes that the lecture hall might be confused he is more than willing to explain it again."
He's awesome!!!
"The math class itself is set up really well with consistent online math homework and weekly quizzes in recitation. Professor Matsuki himself is a very visual teacher. He doesn't really write definitions so much as explain why something happens, what it really means, and draws pictures to show it."
"By far the best math professor I've had in my two years at Purdue. He thoroughly explains each topic and makes sure that nobody has questions before moving on. For as terrible as the Purdue math department is, Kenji is an incredible professor who actually cares about his student. I would take another class taught by him in a heartbeat."
He makes Calc 2 (a very hard class) understandable and pretty funny. It was a pleasure to take his class.
Probably the best Math professor at Purdue. You probably don't need to attend lectures as long as you show up for the review lecture and you should be good for an A.
"Matsuki was by far the best math professor I had at Purdue. 162 Covers some very difficult topics, but Matsuki did a great job making things clear and was always more than willing to help outside of class. His lectures are engaging, easy to follow, and often funny. He speaks clearly and has FANTASTIC handwriting, something many profs sorely lack."
Really cool guy
"Kenji Matsuki is one of the best professors I have seen at Purdue. He is really thorough with his concepts and he is willing to help you. The exams are tough, but if you follow the review he does in class, you shouldn't have a problem."
"Kenji is my absolute favorite math teacher. He makes lectures fun and keeps you paying attention. At the end of the semester, lectures get pretty full, so get there early! Be prepared to work hard, and never do the homework before the day its due. He does homework questions in lecture."
"Most students love Kenji, but I found him to over complicate simple ideas. Often times I had to look up an explanation in the book or online after lecture. The homework is also very difficult at times. However, lectures are usually enjoyable and he usually got a laugh out of me fairly regularly."
"Keep calm and take Matsuki...... If you don't have him, you missed out the best available."
"Absolute best teacher I've had at purdue, he made the unbearable calc 2 easy!"
Best lecturer ever
BLESS HIS SOUL. MOST ENTERTAINING MATH PROFESSOR I'VE HAD AT PURDUE.
"Kenji is the man. Best math professor you'll have at Purdue. He is loved by most everyone, not only for his personality but because he is a solid professor as well."
"One of the best Math Pros you could ever have, absolutely kind and friendly and is truely there to help you succeed. Classes are just not boring at all. You will be involved, your questions will get attention and be well explained. Just make u feel love for math again. Even making special accommodation when you get health problems."
"Kenji is an amazing professor. He explained concepts in a clear and simplified way, providing many examples to make sure you understand the problems. He is really funny as well, so his lectures are worth going to. The exams were not too difficult. He is very, very helpful in his office hours - definitely go if you need help."
"Kenji is my favorite professor by far, and that's impressive for a calc teacher. People would skip their lecture and come to mine just because he is that good of a professor. He will make sure to clearly answer any questions. He makes sure everyone understands in a class of almost 1000 students. He's an amazing professor."
The greatest professor for Purdue freshman year ever.
"Kenji is the best! He makes you laugh all the time! Someone told me to take it Calc 3 with him, even if my other courses had to revolve around the time of this class, totally TOTALLY worth it. Crystal clear, funny and best of all, he writes the exams, so for sure his examples, homework and review sessions are what you'll get in the test! Kenji 3"
Awesome professor - extremely funny and clear of most all subjects. He takes time in class to make sure the material is understood.
"Awesome guy! Tests are hard if you are not used to college exams, but the exams are so similar to the previous exams that if you practice them, the questions should be about the same."
The best math professor I've ever taken. I attended all his lectures because they were fun and I really learned a lot. He's a funny guy and his explanations are fantastic. His diagrams are funny and they really help grasp the material being taught. I was highly disappointed when I realized that he doesn't teach Calc 3.
Best professor. Really wish he can teach calculus 3 and beyond.
Best math professor I've ever seen!
"Kenji is the best. He simply loves what he does and only shows up to class to do everything he can to make sure students understand the material. I'm going to try and take more classes with this professor, if possible."
His jokes are funny
"best professor i ever seen, thanks to him, i get a A in math i will take his class next semester"
Great professor
He's hilarious and enjoyable and makes calculus so much better.
This professor is the best professor I have ever had. He is really funny and good at drawing. His classes are really easy and he really do takes care of us. I hope that he could teach all my math classes.
He's really awesome
Kenji is awesome! He helped me so much and he really does care that we as students did well on the exams. He is also hilarious and I loved the pictures he'd draw during lectures. I wish he taught calc 3 and beyond.
He's really a great teacher! It's a shame that he won't teach MA 166...
"He is the best calculus teacher I ever met. University professors usually make a lecture like a ""lecture"". Kenji makes a lecture like a ""TED TALK""!"
"He missed the first two weeks of class which made the first tests difficult. We were given a sub some days but one day we didn't get one and it was very challenging. I emailed him and though he didn't help me, he did give me the email address of someone who really helped."
"He is the best calc teacher you'll find here, and he is hilarious."
"He is a great professor. At first I was nervous about it because I thought he might be hard to understand. However, he is great! I had him for 165 and could not get into his 166 lecture but go to it instead of my other professor's! He makes things easy to understand and is helpful."
"He explains everything so well. If the class seems to not understand a concept, he'll explain it in different ways. He helps us with our homework. And to top it all off he's funny. It's never a drag to go to his lecture. Many people from other sections show up to his lecture instead."
Kenji is the best professor ever. He teaches very well and also humorous. Lecture is never a dread. I completely disregard my actual math lecture and I just go to his. Thats how good this guy is. AMAZING. Highly recommended
"He scares me. But he is a pretty amazing professor. Never done any of this type of math before, but completely understand it"
Kenji is my favorite teacher i have had here. He makes class fun and useful by going over homework problems every class. Definitely recommend him!!
"Amazing prof.....he made math fun, he has a slight accent but is still easy to understand, i would recommend taking him over any other prof here"
Kenji is awesome!
Great professor. Keeps class interesting and exciting. Slightly fast paced but keeps you from falling asleep.
He is awesome. Makes math extremely fun and interacts well with the students. Well humoured and prepared for all odds. Best professor ever.
"He was an extremely good teacher who taught by showing an example of a new concept, describing the proof/definition for it, then showing another example. I recommend him over any other prof in the MA165/166 system for being not only a great teacher but also a funny one as well."
Made math fun...need I say more?
A little difficult to understand but really makes sure students understand the material
"I love Kenji! The first day of class he wrote his name in Chinese with permanent marker. Great first impression. He always has a smile and makes everyone laugh several times during each class. His methods of doing math sometimes doesn't seem the best way, but he definitely know his stuff and teaches well."
Wonderful prof who makes math easy to learn. Can't think of better profs out there! You have to be in his class to enjoy it.
"He is funny and explains things very well. Even though he is asian, he is easy to understand and speaks clearly."
He is pretty funny guy. Explains really well. And doesnt just read out of the book like every other teacher.
"He's hilarious! Great professor, willing to help and definately fun to have. His key phrase, ""oh no!"""
Kenji is so funny. Sometimes I laugh outloud in class when everyone else is silent. That's how great he is. Plus there hasn't been one day he has failed to wear a striped polo and a popped collar.
he rocks the popped collar every day. What a baller!
"Great professor, very funny."
A little confusing at times... That's when you can understand him of course. Sometimes difficult to follow. Very fun Prof. though.
What a badass!

Somewhat difficult to understand what he is saying at times.
Amazing professor. Helpful. Clear. Enjoyable. He's a great guy with awesome teaching skills.
Very good and a lot of fun.
Matsuki is hilarious. Great teacher. Helps me understand the material better. Pop your colar!
Made the class fun and worth going too. Excellent sense of humor and a great teacher too. If you don't get something the first time he'll stop and re-explain it to you.
"He always helped me out, and made sure that everyone understands, plus he's really funny!"
Definitely made class more interesting. Always had some hilarious joke for the day. Was very clear and thorough. Always offered help
"he subbed, was mad funny and taught extrememly well"
"-lively, energetic, and hilarious...this guy made linear algebra a breeze!"
Subbed for our class for two lectures; taught us more in those two lectures than we learned in the last 12 weeks combined from our other insturctor.
"Funny, and great teacher."
"I have never had a professor that is this attentive to his class. If he sees that you are confused, he will stop and explain it in a different way. Night and day between him and my last 3 math professors."

A sense of humor helps you swallow calculus.
