Most exams are questions pulled from the study guide so learn it by heart.',\n",

Study exam study guides inside and out, as he pulls most questions directly from them--but don't memorize, learn from it too. If you keep up on the quizzes and twice-a-week homework, you'll be fine. Exams are large portion of grade, so prepare soon.\",\n",

This has been said a lot, but the study guides he provides are almost identical to the exam. He wants everyone to pass. That being said, this is still a college calculus course so it will be difficult.\",\n",

       " \"His lectures are good but he sometimes overexplains concepts that arent exactly necessary and he can be very patronizing. The reason i give him a good rating is because he still does a decent job and he gives a study guide for the test that got me A's on every exam.\",\n",

If you miss his lecture, his whole lecture can be found on brightspace after the lecture has ended. Only thing to beware is that he uses brightspace like it is a blog, but it is very easy to get used to.',\n",

He also makes jokes and tells funny stories to help keep the class engaged.
